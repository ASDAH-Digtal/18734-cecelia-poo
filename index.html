        <div class="section1">what is racism?“Racism is Prejudice, bigotry, or hostility directed at a person or group of people because they belong to a minority or disadvantaged racial or ethnic group.’ Or we could say “the belief that various races have unique features, skills, or attributes that can be used to classify them as inferior or superior to one another.”</div><!--section1-->

        <div class="section2">Stop Asian Hate is the name of a series of anti-Asian abuse protests organized across the US in 2021 in reaction to prejudice towards Asian Americans. Many of these protests took place in the aftermath of three Atlanta spa shootings in which eight people were killed, six of whom were Asian women. However, after the kibbutz, the movement started to gain momentum.  The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan in the province of Hubei, has resulted in a rise in prejudice directed towards Asians and Asian Americans. For example, the California State University Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism estimated that hate crimes against Asians rose by 150 percent in 2020 and Stop AAPI Hate has received 3,795 hate crime incidents since its inception.
