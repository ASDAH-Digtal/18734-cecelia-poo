        <div class="section1"><h3>What is racism?</h3>
        <p>“Racism is Prejudice, bigotry, or hostility directed at a person or group of people because they belong to a minority or disadvantaged racial or ethnic group.’ Or we could say “the belief that various races have unique features, skills, or attributes that can be used to classify them as inferior or superior to one another.”</p>
          
         <p> Stop Asian Hate is the name of a series of anti-Asian abuse protests organized across the US in 2021 in reaction to prejudice towards Asian Americans. Many of these protests took place in the aftermath of three Atlanta spa shootings in which eight people were killed, six of whom were Asian women. However, after the kibbutz, the movement started to gain momentum. The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan in the province of Hubei, has resulted in a rise in prejudice directed towards Asians and Asian Americans. For example, the California State University Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism estimated that hate crimes against Asians rose by 150 percent in 2020 and Stop AAPI Hate has received 3,795 hate crime incidents since its inception.</p>

   <P>In the 1960s, the formation of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense (BPP) was a movement created and a direct response to the racist policies and treatment of Black communities. It was a progressive organization with a Black nationalist, socialist, and armed self-defense ideology, particularly in the face of police violence. It was part of the Black Power movement, which opposed integrationist policies.This movement brought awareness to pacific citizens in Newzealand when in the early 1970’s we  found The Polynesian Panther Party  which was called the PPP. This  was a progressive social justice movement established in Tamaki Makaurau (Auckland), New Zealand, to combat ethnic inequalities committed against indigenous Mori and Pacific Islanders (New Zealand). On June 16, 1971, a group of young Polynesian men founded an organization.The Panthers used advocacy and agitation, as well as schooling, legal assistance, and other social services, to help communities improve. The American Black Panther Party, especially Huey Newton's policy of Black unity through his global call-to-action, had a strong impact on the community. The Polynesian Panthers worked to raise consciousness and fight oppressive social ties that afflicted Pasfikas.Segregation, racial discrimination, excessive incarceration, and sports segregation are only a few examples. Will 'Ilolahia, a founding member and key coordinator of the PPP.</P>
